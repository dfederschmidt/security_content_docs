#### Description

The following analytic identifies the use of CacheDump with the `-v` parameter to dump cached credentials on the associated endpoint. Adversaries use Cachedump as it is a publicly-available tool that extracts cached password hashes from a system&#39;s registry.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:

> :information_source:
> **credential_extractionfgdump_and_cachedump_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* dest_device_id
* process_name
* _time
* process_path
* dest_user_id
* process
* cmd_line



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
#### Known False Positives
False positives will be limited as this analytic targets specific credential dumping process names. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 63.0 | 70 | 90 | Malicious actor is accessing stored credentials via FGDump or CacheDump tools. Operation is performed at the device $dest_device_id$, by the account $dest_user_id$ via process $process_name$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
